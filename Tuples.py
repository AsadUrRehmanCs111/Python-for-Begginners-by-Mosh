# Tuples are just like list but only difference is they can not be modified mean we can not add ,
# remove or update item in tuple
# They are immutable. and also defined using square brackets

numbers = (1, 2, 3)
print(numbers.count(2))
print(numbers.index(3))

# we can access them like list but not modify them
